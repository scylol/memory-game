## Why Simone
If you ever want to play a fun and addicting game to test out your memory, Simone is the game for you. It's a great time killer, and extremely easy to play on the go. See how many levels deep you can get, the games gets hard really quickly. Good Luck!

## What Simone
Simone is a clone of the popular game Simon. Once you click the start button, you will be taken to a screen with 3 different colored sections. Shortly after, one section will light up one after the other. Then once they are done lighting up, you have to click on the sections in the order in which they lit up. If you pass the level, one additional section will light up the next time, so pay attention! Simone is a little different for Simon because every level is completely random. Simon would use the order from the last level, and add onto it, but Simon has a different pattern everytime, so its a little harder.
